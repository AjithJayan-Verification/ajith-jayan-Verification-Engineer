# Hi, I’m Ajith 👋

🎯 **VLSI Verification Engineer | SystemVerilog | UVM | SOC | FPGA Enthusiast**

I am highly interested in the **Verification domain of VLSI**, with hands-on experience in building **SystemVerilog and UVM-based verification environments**. I enjoy working on **protocol-based verification**, **memory subsystems**, and exploring **SoC and FPGA-level design and verification workflows**.
